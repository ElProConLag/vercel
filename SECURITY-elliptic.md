# Security Advisory: Elliptic ECDSA Signature Validation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect against vulnerabilities in the `elliptic` cryptographic library, specifically related to ECDSA signature validation issues.

## Vulnerability Details

The `elliptic` library had vulnerabilities in earlier versions where valid ECDSA signatures could be erroneously rejected, potentially causing authentication or cryptographic validation failures. This issue affects versions prior to 6.6.1.

**CVE References:**
- CVE-2022-23632: Improper signature verification in elliptic
- Additional security fixes in recent versions

## Affected Versions

- `elliptic < 6.6.1`: Vulnerable to ECDSA signature validation issues

## Mitigation Strategy

### 1. Package Overrides

The repository enforces a secure version of `elliptic` through package manager overrides in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "elliptic": "6.6.1"
    }
  },
  "overrides": {
    "elliptic": "6.6.1"
  }
}
```

This ensures that all dependencies, even transitive ones, use the secure version of `elliptic`.

### 2. Version Enforcement

- **Secure Version**: `6.6.1` (latest stable with security fixes)
- **Override Strategy**: Force all elliptic dependencies to use the secure version
- **Coverage**: Applies to all direct and transitive dependencies

## Security Testing

The repository includes automated tests to:
1. Verify the secure version is enforced across all package lock files
2. Prevent regression to vulnerable versions
3. Validate ECDSA signature handling behavior

## Verification

To verify the mitigation is in place:

```bash
# Check that all resolved elliptic versions are secure
grep -r "elliptic" package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml | grep -E "(resolved|version)"

# Run security tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="elliptic-ecdsa-validation"
```

## Impact

With this mitigation in place:
- All ECDSA signature validations use the secure elliptic implementation
- Valid signatures are correctly accepted
- Invalid signatures are correctly rejected
- Cryptographic operations maintain expected security properties

## Maintenance

This security measure should be reviewed when:
- New versions of elliptic are released
- Security advisories are published for elliptic
- Cryptographic dependencies are updated
