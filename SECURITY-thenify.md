# Security: thenify Package Vulnerability Mitigation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect against the `eval` vulnerability in the `thenify` package.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Affected versions**: `thenify@<3.3.1`
- **Issue**: Unsafe calls to `eval` in versions prior to 3.3.1
- **Description**: Versions of thenify before 3.3.1 made use of unsafe calls to `eval`, which could potentially be exploited for code injection attacks.

## Current Protection

### 1. Safe Version Usage
- **Current**: `thenify@3.3.1` (safe version)
- **Status**: ✅ SAFE - The repository uses the fixed version 3.3.1
- **Verification**: Security tests confirm the safe version is in use

### 2. Version Overrides
The root `package.json` includes pnpm and npm overrides to prevent accidental installation of vulnerable versions:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "thenify@<3.3.1": ">=3.3.1"
    }
  },
  "overrides": {
    "thenify@<3.3.1": ">=3.3.1"
  }
}
```

This ensures that if any dependency tries to install a vulnerable version of thenify (< 3.3.1), it will be upgraded to the fixed version (>= 3.3.1).

### 3. Security Tests
Comprehensive tests in `packages/cli/test/unit/util/thenify-security.test.ts` verify that:
- The current thenify version is safe (>= 3.3.1)
- No vulnerable versions are accidentally introduced
- Current package versions are documented for security tracking

## Vulnerability Technical Details

### Vulnerable Pattern (thenify@<3.3.1)
Earlier versions of thenify used unsafe `eval` calls which could potentially:
- Execute arbitrary code if malicious input was provided
- Bypass security restrictions in some environments
- Introduce code injection vulnerabilities

### Fixed Pattern (thenify@>=3.3.1)
Version 3.3.1 and later:
- ✅ Removed unsafe `eval` calls
- ✅ Implemented safer code execution patterns
- ✅ Improved input validation and sanitization

## Attack Vector Prevention

The vulnerability could potentially be exploited if:
1. Malicious input is passed to thenify functions
2. The malicious input contains executable code
3. The vulnerable version executes this code via `eval`

With version 3.3.1+:
- Unsafe `eval` calls have been removed
- Input is processed safely without code execution risks

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain current version** thenify@3.3.1 or later
2. **Monitor** for new thenify package releases and security advisories
3. **Test thoroughly** if upgrading thenify-related dependencies
4. **Keep the package overrides** to prevent accidental vulnerable installations
