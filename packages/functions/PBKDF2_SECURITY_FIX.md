# Crypto Security Fix

## PBKDF2 Uninitialized Memory Vulnerability

### Problem Statement

The original issue was that pbkdf2 implementations could return predictable uninitialized/zero-filled memory for non-normalized or unimplemented algorithms. This creates a security vulnerability where:

1. **Uninitialized Memory Exposure**: When invalid algorithm names are passed to pbkdf2, some implementations return uninitialized memory instead of proper error handling
2. **Predictable Output**: This can result in predictable "random" keys that compromise security
3. **Data Leakage**: Uninitialized memory might contain sensitive data from previous operations

### Solution

The `securePBKDF2` function in `packages/functions/src/crypto.ts` addresses this vulnerability by:

1. **Algorithm Validation**: Validates algorithm names against a strict whitelist before processing
2. **Explicit Error Handling**: Throws clear TypeErrors for invalid algorithms instead of returning uninitialized memory
3. **Input Validation**: Validates all parameters to prevent other potential vulnerabilities
4. **Secure Implementation**: Uses the Web Crypto API with proper error wrapping

### Supported Algorithms

Only the following normalized algorithm names are supported:
- `SHA-1`
- `SHA-256` 
- `SHA-384`
- `SHA-512`

Any other algorithm name (including lowercase variants like `sha256`) will result in a TypeError.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { securePBKDF2, generateSalt } from '@vercel/functions';

const password = new TextEncoder().encode('user-password');
const salt = generateSalt(32);

try {
  const derivedKey = await securePBKDF2(password, {
    algorithm: 'SHA-256',
    iterations: 100000,
    keyLength: 32,
    salt
  });
  console.log('Key derived successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Key derivation failed:', error.message);
}
```

### Security Benefits

1. **No Uninitialized Memory**: Invalid algorithms cannot trigger uninitialized memory returns
2. **Clear Error Messages**: Developers get immediate feedback on invalid algorithm usage
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types prevent many common mistakes at compile time
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All edge runtime environments behave identically

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `packages/functions/test/unit/crypto.test.ts` that verify:

- All supported algorithms work correctly
- Invalid algorithms are properly rejected
- Non-normalized algorithms are rejected
- Edge cases are handled securely
- Parameter validation works as expected

Run the demonstration with:
```bash
cd packages/functions
node demo-security.js
```

### Integration

This fix is available in the `@vercel/functions` package and can be used in:
- Edge Functions
- Serverless Functions  
- Middleware
- Any Vercel runtime environment

The functions are exported from the main package entry point and include full TypeScript support.
